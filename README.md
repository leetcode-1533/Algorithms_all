Hi,

I paused this project.

I think this is efficient as it caches previous computation for later usage. But the memory usage way more exceeds requirements. I found other passed examples but I don't find them in anyway optimized the computation speed. 

So all in all, it is only a 90% assignments which meets all logic and timing requirement.
